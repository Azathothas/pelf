NOTE: My lib4bin automatically creates a directory like those generated by https://github.com/VHSgunzo/sharun/blob/main/lib4bin, it also adds ./sharun to it (it must be in PATH)
NOTE: Do not use the Go or C version of dynexec, they relies on execve instead of a user space exec implementation (since there isn't any)
